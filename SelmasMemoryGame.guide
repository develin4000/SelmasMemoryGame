 Why another memory game ?

 My daughter wanted me to make a game for her and she had a lot of huge ideas.
 And since I thought that it would be good for her to be part of I came up with
 the idea to start in a little gentle way until the bigger plans will be done =)
 
 This is a very simple game, but we think that it can be fun for kids to play
 and train their memory capabilites.

 That's the basic story behind this game.

@ENDNODE

 No installation needed, just place it where you want and start it for some memory training

@NODE "usage" "Selmas Memory Game - Usage"
@PREV "install"
@NEXT "faq"

 @{b}@{u}Usage@{uu}@{ub}

 The game interface consist of a card area (6, 18 or 32 cards)

 The idea is to find pairs of the same image and if they are found the
 level gauge on the right side increas.
 When all cards are found the game is finished.

 The interface also consist of a couple of buttons 

 @{b}· New Game :@{ub}
   By pressing this game, a new fresh board will be generated.
   The current active game will be ended.


 @{b}· About Game :@{ub}
   Here you see the information about the game like author and copyrights etc.


 @{b}· Settings :@{ub}
   By selecting this one you can adjust the size of the board where
   Tiny   = 6 cards
   Medium = 18 cards
   Big    = 32 cards

   Pressing the @{b}Use@{ub} button will generate a new board with the options selected.
   Cancel will ignore the changes.

* @{b}Q = Question@{ub}
* @{b}A = Answer@{ub}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q - Why can't I use the big board type on my computer ?

A - Since the images are static at the moment the board needs a rather big
    screen in the biggest board type. This will change in the future.
